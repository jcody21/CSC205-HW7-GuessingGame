<h3>Specification</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
Write a program that enables a user to play number guessing games. 
The following is a nutshell description of a number guessing game.
</p>
<pre>   + a random number is generated
   + loop prompting the user to enter guesses
     until the user guesses the number or hits
     the maximum number of allowed guesses or 
     enters the "quit" sentinel value
</pre>
<p>
The rest of this specification documents number guessing games
in more detail. The documentation uses manifest constants that 
can be used by your program.
</p>
<h5>Playing a Guessing Game</h5>
<p>
Use a <code><b>class Random</b></code> object to get a random 
number between MIN_NUMBER (1) and MAX_NUMBER (205), inclusive. 
</p>
<p>
Print the ENTER_GUESS_PROMPT and read the user input.  
Loop until one of the following are true.
</p><pre>   + the user enters the random number 
     - print WINNER_MSG along with number of guesses

   + the user enters MAX_GUESSES (10) wrong guesses
     - print LOSER_MSG along with the random number

   + the user enters QUIT_VALUE (-1)
     - print QUITTER_MSG

   The current game ends in all three of these cases.
   (see "End of Game Processing" section)
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>
If the user enters BACKDOOR_VALUE (-314), print the random number 
and re-prompt the user to enter a guess. BACKDOOR_VALUE input is 
not counted as a wrong guess.
</p>
<p>
Print a INPUT_TOO_SMALL_MSG or INPUT_TOO_LARGE_MSG message when the user 
enters a number that is either less than MIN_NUMBER or greater than 
MAX_NUMBER, respectively.  Re-prompt the user to enter a guess after 
printing the message. Invalid inputs are not counted as wrong guesses.
</p>
<p>
Print a NOPE_NOPE_MSG message when the user enters a 
wrong guess more than once and re-prompt the user to
enter a guess.  Duplicate wrong guesses are not counted
as wrong guess.
</p>
<p>
Print a NOPE_MSG when the user enters a wrong guess.  At
HINT_THRESHOLD (5) wrong guesses, print a HIGHER_MSG or 
LOWER_MSG message.  Re-prompt the user to enter a guess.
</p>
<h5>End of Game Processing</h5>
<p>
If number of games played equals MAX_GAMES (4), then do 
"Post Game Playing Processing." Otherwise, issue the 
PLAY_AGAIN_PROMPT. Do "Post Game Playing Processing" 
if user enters 'n', else start new game.
</p>
<h5>Post Game Playing Processing</h5>
<p>
Print the following prior to exiting the program.
</p>
<ul>
<li> number of games played </li>
<li> number of games won </li>
<li> number of games lost </li>
<li> number of games quit </li>
<li> winning percentage </li>
</ul>
<p>
Also print game summaries for each game played.
</p>
<pre>games played: 3; won: 1; lost: 1; quit: 1; winning pct.: 33.33%

game 1: Won; the number was: 145; #guesses: 6; backdoored: true
...guesses in ascending order: 1,2,3,4,5,

game 2: Quit; the number was: 49; #guesses: 3; backdoored: false
...guesses in ascending order: 1,2,3,

game 3: Lost; the number was: 182; #guesses: 10; backdoored: true
...guesses in ascending order: 1,5,144,150,181,183,191,199,200,201,
</pre>
<h5>Manifest Constants</h5>
<p>
Your program can <a href="http://azfoo.net/gdt/csc205/assignments/02019/I_GG.java.txt">implements I_GG</a>
to use the manifest constants defined in the interface.
I_GG can be copied/pasted after (or before) the declaration
of your class.
</p>
<h5>To Support Testing (i.e. test mode)</h5>
<p>
If the program is executed with a command-line argument,
then the random number for each game is DFLT_NUMBER (60).
</p>
<p>
The motivation for supporting test mode is to play
games without having to play games.
